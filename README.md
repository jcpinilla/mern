# Surfinsta

With this app you will be able to surf through Instagram tags. You never know where you will end up!
You can search for a tag or select it from the tags that other users (or even you) have searched previously. After you select the tag, you will be presented with the most frequent tags in the popular posts that were found by Instagram. You can also continue surfing by clicking these frequent tags.
This app was made using MongoDB, Express, React and Node. The app is deployed [here](http://surfinsta.herokuapp.com/), make sure to check it out. Feel free to explore the app yourself by following these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/jcpinilla/mern.git
cd mern
npm install
cd client
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
npm start
```
The app will be running in [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). The app uses MongoDB to store searched tags, so make sure to configure the MongoDB daemon process.
